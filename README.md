# Cool-Text-Editor

## Description

I learned how to use webpack and babel to create a text editor that can be used to create and save markdown files. I also learned how to use the file system module to save and read files. I also learned how to use the inquirer module to create a command line interface. I also learned how to use the jest module to create unit tests for the application.
